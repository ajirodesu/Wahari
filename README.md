# Wahari

**A 34 MB-class language model that runs entirely on your Android phone and does what you say.**

Modified by **AjiroDesu**. Model by [Cactus Compute](https://github.com/cactus-compute/needle), screen-automation core by [TherealCitali](https://github.com/TherealCitali).

Chat with it, control the hardware, and let it drive the screen — no cloud, no API key, no Termux.

Every push builds a **signed, installable APK** in GitHub Actions:

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| **Releases ▸ `wahari-latest`** | always the newest signed APK from `main` |
| **Releases ▸ `wahari-build-<n>`** | one signed APK per build (last 10 kept) |
| **Actions ▸ a run ▸ Artifacts** | `Wahari-0.0.<n>-<sha>.apk` + `SHA256SUMS` |

The workflow verifies the APK's signature with `apksigner` before it uploads anything, so
every artefact it hands you is signed and ready to install. Android will warn about
sideloading — that is normal for an app installed outside the Play Store.

## What it does

Three parts, one app, all local:

**1. Chat that acts.** Ask in plain English. [Needle 3](https://huggingface.co/Cactus-Compute/needle3)
by Cactus Compute runs on the phone, picks the tool that matches your sentence, and the app
performs it natively:

> *"turn on the flashlight"* · *"what's my battery at?"* · *"vibrate for 1 second"* ·
> *"copy Hello World to clipboard"* · *"where am I right now?"* · *"what network am I on?"* ·
> *"send sms to +91… saying hello"* · *"open WhatsApp"* · *"take a screenshot"* · *"read my last 3 texts"*

Before, those commands went through Termux and the Termux:API app. They are now native Android
calls, so nothing else has to be installed.

**2. Screen automation.** Describe a job and the app reviews a plan with you, then carries it out
through an Accessibility Service — one validated action at a time, with a floating **Stop** pill,
safety classification, redaction of passwords and OTPs, and a confirmation before anything
high-risk:

> *"open Settings and turn on battery saver"* · *"open Chrome and search Kotlin coroutines"* ·
> *"draft a WhatsApp message to John saying I'll be there in 10 minutes, don't send it"*

The decision step uses the same on-device model. If you also have the standalone
[TaskPilot](https://github.com/TherealCitali/TaskPilot) app installed, Automate mode offers a
hand-off that copies the command and opens it.

**3. Remote control.** Text your phone through a Telegram bot; the messages run the same
on-device model and answer in the chat. Useful when the phone is in another room or another city.

## First run

1. **Install the APK** from the latest release or a workflow artefact (any device on
   Android 7.0+, 32- or 64-bit ARM, x86 Chromebook or emulator).
2. **Download the model** — 35 MB, once. Tap *Download* in the chat (or Settings → On-device
   model). It is checksum-verified against the hash the build was compiled with, resumes if it
   drops, and can also be imported from a `.cact` file for air-gapped installs. After that the app
   is fully offline.
3. **Grant what you want to use** — the Tools page lists every permission with a one-tap *Grant missing*.
   Nothing is required: the chat still answers without them.
4. **For screen automation** — Settings → *Accessibility settings* → enable **Wahari screen
   automation**.

```

**The engine.** Cactus Compute publishes the Needle runtime as a static archive per Android ABI.
CMake fetches the `arm64-v8a` archive at configure time, verifies its SHA-256, and links it
into `libneedlejni.so`, so the APK carries a real inference engine and the weights stay a one-time
download. Cached archives are re-verified (a stale cache is deleted and refetched, never linked
silently). The other ABIs (`armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64`, `x86`) build a stub bridge, so the APK still
installs and runs there and honestly reports the engine as unavailable for that CPU.
`needle_init` builds the static prefix from a system prompt plus the tool schemas — the
same contract the Python package uses — and the decode grammar then guarantees that every reply
is a valid tool call.

**The tools.** ~25 tools across four packs (Essentials, Device & screen, Calls & messages,
Camera & identity). Every declared tool shares the model's context, so packs can be switched off;
if the catalogue still does not fit, the app falls back to the Essentials set and says so.

**The automation core** is TaskPilot's, vendored and rewired: `AgentEngine`, `SafetyPolicy`,
`UiTree`/`Redactor`, `NeedleAccessibilityService`, the overlays and the DataStore/Keystore-backed
settings. Only the decision step changed — instead of an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, the
automation actions are declared to Needle as tools (`tap`, `type_text`, `swipe`, `press_key`,
`open_app`, `ask_user`, `task_complete`, `task_failed`) and the returned call is converted into the
action contract the existing loop, policy and executor already validated. A remote
OpenAI-compatible provider and the deterministic built-in routines remain as fallbacks.

## Signing

Release APKs are always signed. The repository ships a **project keystore**
(`android/keystore/needle-release.p12`, alias `needle`, store password `needle-release`) so a fresh
clone, a fork or a pull request can all produce an installable APK with no setup. That key is
public by design — good for sideloading, **not** for Play Store uploads.

For a private key, set these four repository secrets and the workflow uses them instead:

| Secret | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `KEYSTORE` | base64 of a `.p12`/`.jks` (`base64 -w0 my.p12`) |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | store password |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | key alias |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | key password |

The same four values can be passed to a local build as the environment variables
`NEEDLE_KEYSTORE_FILE`, `NEEDLE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `NEEDLE_KEY_ALIAS` and `NEEDLE_KEY_PASSWORD`.
If the committed keystore cannot be read, the workflow generates a fresh PKCS#12 for that single
build and warns — a build never fails for want of a signature.

Two more knobs: `NEEDLE_VERSION_CODE` / `NEEDLE_VERSION_NAME` (the workflow sets these from the run
number); `NEEDLE_ABIS` (default `arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a,x86_64,x86` — set `NEEDLE_ABIS=arm64-v8a`
for a smaller phone-only APK); and `NEEDLE_ALLOW_STUB=ON`, which lets an `arm64-v8a` build
succeed without the engine when the download fails — the app then says so instead of
pretending to think.

**Developer certificate.** The app proves its own identity at runtime: Settings → Developer
certificate shows the developer (AjiroDesu), package name, version and the SHA-256 fingerprint
of the APK signing certificate, with a tap-to-copy button. Compare it with
`apksigner verify --print-certs` or the release `SHA256SUMS`. Details:
[`DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE.md`](DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE.md). To make the in-app badge report
`VERIFIED` instead of `UNPINNED`, bake in the expected fingerprint:

| Secret / env var | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `EXPECTED_CERT_SHA256` (secret) / `WAHARI_EXPECTED_CERT_SHA256` (env) | colon-separated SHA-256 of the release signing certificate |

A build whose runtime certificate differs from the pinned value reports `MISMATCH` — treat it
as untrusted.

## What a build does

Each run of the workflow (`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`) does this, in order:

1. installs the SDK, build-tools, NDK and CMake the app needs;
2. downloads `libneedle.a` from `Cactus-Compute/needle3` and checks its SHA-256;
3. downloads `needle3.cact`, hashes it, and passes that checksum and size into Gradle — so the
   checksum an APK enforces on first run is always the checksum of the bytes that are really
   published;
4. builds `:app:assembleRelease` with the release keystore;
5. asserts the APK's package name, `libneedlejni.so` in all four ABIs (`arm64-v8a`,
   `armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64`, `x86`) and the real engine inside `arm64-v8a`, then verifies
   the signature with `apksigner` and writes `SHA256SUMS`;
6. uploads `Wahari-0.0.<run>-<sha>.apk` as an artifact, publishes the `wahari-build-<run>`
   pre-release (newest 10 kept) and, on `main`, refreshes `wahari-latest`;
7. runs the JVM unit tests — the tool-schema shape the engine's grammar compiles, the safety
   policy that guards screen automation, the developer-certificate fingerprint helpers and the
   device-compatibility contract. They run last on purpose: a failing test turns the build
   red, but it can never be the reason a release is missing its APK;
8. a second job boots an x86_64 emulator, installs the APK it just built, launches it and fails the
   run if the app dies, lands in the crash buffer, or is not the resumed activity. It also uploads
   a launch screenshot as an artifact — that job can never block the APK, only report on it.

Every build also records what it resolved (weights hash, APK hash) on the `ci-logs` branch.

## Building it yourself

```bash
# JDK 17, Android SDK (platform 35, build-tools 35.0.0), NDK 27.2.12479018, CMake 3.22.1
cd android
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease          # signed → app/build/outputs/apk/release/
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug            # installable side-by-side build (.debug suffix)
./gradlew :app:testReleaseUnitTest      # JVM tests (schemas, safety, certificate, compatibility)
```

CMake downloads `libneedle.a` (SHA-256 verified) on the first build and caches it in
`app/src/main/cpp/prebuilt/`; a stale cache is deleted and refetched, never linked silently.
The release APK is universal: `arm64-v8a` (real engine), `armeabi-v7a` (stub — Cactus's 32-bit
archive no longer links against current NDKs, so the app installs and runs there and says the
engine is unavailable for that CPU), plus `x86_64`/`x86` stubs for emulators and Chromebooks.
Override with `NEEDLE_ABIS` (e.g. `NEEDLE_ABIS=arm64-v8a` for a smaller APK).

## Privacy and safety

- The model, the downloaded weights, the accessibility snapshots and the task history never leave
  the phone. There is no analytics and no telemetry.
- Accessibility-tree values are redacted before the model sees them: password fields and
  credential-shaped strings (OTP, card numbers, PINs, IDs) are masked.
- `SafetyPolicy` classifies every action; typing into a sensitive field or auto-typing a credential
  is refused outright, and sending, deleting, paying, installing or granting permissions asks again.
- The **Stop** pill is always reachable while a task runs, and the loop stops rather than guessing
  after five failures or a frozen screen.
- The only network calls are the one-time model download, Telegram if you enable it, and an
  AI provider if you configure one.

## Limitations

- **Installs everywhere, thinks on 64-bit ARM.** The APK installs on any Android 7.0+ device
  (phones, tablets, foldables, Chromebooks, emulators — every major ABI, all screens, no
  mandatory hardware features). On-device inference needs `arm64-v8a`; on other CPUs the app
  runs and says the engine is unavailable for that CPU instead of pretending to think.
- The Needle model is small on purpose. It is excellent at picking tools and filling arguments and
  it says so when a request is out of scope; it is not a general chatbot.
- Secure screens, WebViews and apps that block accessibility cannot be automated — the loop pauses
  and tells you instead of guessing.
- Camera capture and fingerprint checks need the app on screen; everything else works in the
  background.
- Changing the screen brightness needs the "Modify system settings" permission (Tools page).
- Wi-Fi `ssid`/scan results need location permission, an Android restriction, not a choice.

## The original Termux assistant

The Python app this repository started as is still here and unchanged: `app.py` (Flask web UI +
Telegram bot) and `termux_needle.py` (CLI), using the `cactus-needle` package and the `termux-*`
commands. See the git history for its setup guide, or:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py                            # web UI on http://127.0.0.1:5000
python3 termux_needle.py                  # CLI
```

The Android app is the same idea without the Termux dependency.
